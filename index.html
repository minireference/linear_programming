<h1 id="linear-programming-tutorial">Linear programming tutorial</h1>

<p><a href="https://ivanistheone.github.io/linear_programming/tutorial.pdf">This short tutorial on linear programming</a> used to be part of the <a href="http://gum.co/noBSLA">No bullshit guide to linear algebra</a>, but was cut from the main text of the book, because it might not be interesting to all readers.</p>
<p>Business students will find this tutorial useful as it gives three points of view: - algorithmic (the steps of the simplex algorithm) - graphical (visual representation of the various coordinate systems used during algorithm) - numerical (practical computations using the computer algebr system SymPy)</p>

<p>This &quot;feature cut&quot; was done back in Jun 2015. Here is the commit message:</p>

summary:     Moved Linear Programming out of Applications chapter. 
             No way I can hold the readers attention for 20 pages with that shit. 
             Will release it as a bonus free tutorial or something.</code></pre>
